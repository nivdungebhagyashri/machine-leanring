# # Problem Set 1
# 
# ### Before You Start
# 
# For this problem set, you should
# download flights.csv.bz2 and weather.csv.bz2 datasets from
# Canvas (files-data).   Rename the notebook to
# LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME-PS1.ipynb.
# 
# When done, please submit
# 1. the notebook itself
# 2. the rendered html or pdf of it.
# 
# Note: you do not have to use notebooks to solve this PS.  However, you have to submit
# * your code
# * your results
# * your explanations
# whatever means you use to solve this assignment.
# 
# It is all fine to discuss the problems and way how to solve these with
# your classmates and instructors.  However, the solutions must be your
# own.  Don't copy-paste each other solutions!

# ## About the Problem Set: 
# 
# This problem set is rather similar to ones used for R, dplyr, and
# flights data.  Just we use python and pandas.
# 
# Your task is to analyze the nycflights13 data (in the R package of the
#                                                same name).  The
#                                                necessary csv
# files are provided on canvas (in files/data).  An easy way to get the
# explanations is on the the [package page on R documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/nycflights13/versions/1.0.0). 
# 
# In this problem set you will perform a basic exploratory analysis on
# an example dataset, bringing to bear all of your new skills in data
# manipulation and visualization. You will be required to submit well
# commented python code, documenting all code used in this problem set,
# along with a write up answering all questions below. Use figures as
# appropriate to support your answers, and when required by the problem.
# 
# Always comment your results, preferably in a separate markdown cell.

# ## Some Tips
# 
# * This assignment involves extensive Data frame splitting and
#   aggregation. You should look into the details of the methods
#   groupby, transform, sum, count, mean etc 
# * Many of the tasks in the assignment can be done either through the
#   Pandas Data Frame or by converting the data frames to Series. Many
#   of the methods in the numpy are applicable to Series only. When
#   stuck, try to explore the type of object (Pandas Data Frame or Numpy
#   Series) you are dealing with. 

# ## Question 1
# 
# Letâ€™s explore flights from NYC to LA. Use the flights dataset to answer the following questions.
# 
# ### (a)
# 
# How many flights were there from NYC airports to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in 2013?

# In[19]:


# Your code here
flights_df_nyc_to_lax = flights_df.loc[flights_df['dest'] == 'LAX']
len(flights_df_nyc_to_lax)


# ## Answer
# There are 16174 flights from NYC airports to LAX in 2013

# ### (b)
# 
# Which airline ('carrier') has the most flights from NYC to LAX? Which one has the least number of flights? Report the numbers respectively. 

# In[23]:


# Your code here
# Check number of flights for each airline
flights_df_nyc_to_lax['carrier'].value_counts()


# ## Answer
# UA has the maximum number of flights i.e 5823 from NYC to LAX where as B6 has the least number of flights i.e 1688. The numbers for each carrier are reported above.

# ### (c)
# 
# How many unique air planes fly from NYC to LAX?
# (Hint: use 'tailnum', essentially the license plate of airplane)

# In[24]:


# Your code here
flights_df_nyc_to_lax['tailnum'].nunique()


# ## Answer
# There are 991 unique flights from NYC to LAX
# 

# ### (d)
# 
# What is the average arrival delay for flights from NYC to LAX?

# In[25]:


# Your code here
flights_df_nyc_to_lax['arr_delay'].mean()


# ## Answer
# The average arrival delay for flights from NYC to LAX is 0.5471109447148383

# ### (e)
# 
# What proportion of flights to LAX come from each NYC airport?

# In[58]:


# Your code here
total_count = len(flights_df_nyc_to_lax)
jfk_count = len(flights_df_nyc_to_lax[flights_df_nyc_to_lax['origin']=='JFK'])
lga_count = len(flights_df_nyc_to_lax[flights_df_nyc_to_lax['origin']=='LGA'])
ewr_count = len(flights_df_nyc_to_lax[flights_df_nyc_to_lax['origin']=='EWR'])
print('Proportion Percentage of JFK Airport to LAX %.1f ' % ((jfk_count*100)/float(total_count)))
print('Proportion Percentage of LGA Airport to LAX %.1f ' % ((lga_count*100)/float(total_count)))
print('Proportion Percentage of EWR Airport to LAX %.1f ' % ((ewr_count*100)/float(total_count)))


# ## Question 2
# 
# Now let's explore the entire NYC flight dataset. Flights are often delayed. Consider the following questions exploring delay patterns.
# 
# ### (a)
# 
# Which date has the largest average departure delay? Which date has the largest average arrival delay?

# In[77]:


# Your code here
# Adding the Date column by concatenating yyyy-mm-dd
flights_df['date'] = flights_df['year'].astype(str) + "-" + flights_df['month'].astype(str) + "-" + flights_df['day'].astype(str)
# Creating a new dataframe with departure delay averages by date
avg_by_date = pd.DataFrame(flights_df.groupby('date').mean())

# Finding the date with the maximum average departure delay
print 'The date with largest average departure delay is'
print avg_by_date.sort_values(['dep_delay'], ascending = False)['dep_delay'].head(1)


# Finding the date with the maximum average arrival delay
print '\nThe date with largest average arrival delay is'
print avg_by_date.sort_values(['arr_delay'], ascending = False)['arr_delay'].head(1)


# ### (b)
# 
# What was the worst day and the best day to fly out of NYC in 2013
# if you dislike delayed flights?
# 
# Note: we ask the largest delay given there was a (positive) delay, we
# don't care about flights that were in time or early.

# In[113]:


# Your code here
# Highest departure delay of a flight in a day. 
dep_delay = flights_df[flights_df['dep_delay'] > 0]
dep_delay = dep_delay.set_index(['date'])
print "\nHighest delay in the departure of a flight was on:"
print dep_delay.sort_values(['dep_delay'], ascending = False)['dep_delay'].head(1)
print "\Smallers delay in the departure of a flight was on:"
print dep_delay.sort_values(['dep_delay'], ascending = True)['dep_delay'].head(1)


# ## Answer
# The worst day to fly out of NYC in 2013 is 2013-1-9 and best day to fly out of NYC is 2013-4-25

# ### (c)
# 
# On average which airline has the lowest departure delay for
#    their NYC flights in 2013 in this dataset? and which one has the
#    greatest departure delay?
# 
# Note: here we want to include both positive and negative delays (early departures)   

# In[85]:


# Your code here
flights_df.groupby('carrier')['dep_delay'].mean()


# ## Answer
# The airline F9 has the highest departure delay of 20.215543 and airline US has the smallest departure delay of 3.782418

# ### (d)
# 
# Are there any seasonal patterns in departure delays for flights from NYC?

# In[87]:


# Your code here
flights_df.head()
matplotlib.style.use('ggplot') 
plt.plot(flights_df.groupby('month')['dep_delay'].mean())
plt.xlabel('Months', size = 12)
plt.ylabel('Avg Departure delay in mins', size = 12)
plt.title('Avg Departure Delay in mins by Month')
plt.show()

# Exploring the seasonal patterns in total number of delayed by Month
plt.plot(dep_delay.groupby('month').count())
plt.xlabel('Months', size = 12)
plt.ylabel('Total Number of Delayed Flights', size = 12)
plt.title('Total Number of Delayed Flights by Month')
plt.show()


# ## Answer
# Yes, there seem to be some patterns in the flight departure delays. Mostly, the holiday season shows spike in the average flight departure delay time during the months of June, July and December. These months have the highest average delayed time. The second graph also shows the total number of flights delayed in a given month and again July and December comes out with most number of delayed flights in total. This clearly shows that the Summer and winter break are the periods where people take during these months of the year in terms of season.

# ### (e)
# 
# On average, how do departure delays vary over the course of a day?

# In[88]:


# Your code here
# Exploring data for departure delay trends over the course of a day
dep_delay_hour = pd.DataFrame(flights_df.groupby('hour')['dep_delay'].mean()) # Group by hour
dep_delay_hour.index.name = None

# Plotting Data
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.bar(range(25), dep_delay_hour.dep_delay, 0.70)
plt.xlabel('Hour of the Day', size = 12)
plt.ylabel('Avg Departure Delay', size = 12)
plt.title('Avg Departure Delay over the course of a day')
plt.show()

# Calculating the number of flights by hour of the day
count_flights_hour = flights_df.groupby('hour').count()
count_flights_hour.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'count'}, inplace=True)
count_flights_hour.index.name = None


# ## Answer
# From the plot it is clear that the delays are more prominent during the night mainly between 10 PM and 4 AM. A possible reason could be low visibility condition during these hours or other factors like fog or bad weather conditions. The delay in flight departures go down significantly in other hours of the day. 
# 
# Also, another point to note is that the number of flights in these late hours are fewer than others. This can be a  possible reason why the average of the departure delay times is higher during 10 PM - 4 AM (fewer flights and most flights delayed: Example: Only 11 flights around 3 AM).
# 

# 
# 
# ## Question 3
# 
# Which flight departing NYC in 2013 flew the slowest?
# 
# Note: compute the speed as distance/time.

# In[109]:


# Your code here
flights_df['speed'] = flights_df.distance/(flights_df.air_time/60)
x = ['date','carrier','tailnum','flight','origin','dest','air_time','distance','speed']
flights_df.sort_values('speed',ascending = True)[x].head(1)


# ## Answer
# The flight 1860 flew the slowest of carrier US with tailnum N755US. The flight covered the distance of 96 miles in 75 mins with an average speed of 76.8 miles per hour.
# 

# ## Question 4
# 
# Which flights (i.e. carrier + flight + dest) happen every day? Where do they fly to?

# In[100]:


# Your code here
flights_df['flight_combo'] = flights_df['carrier'].astype(str) + ' ' + flights_df['flight'].astype(str) + ' ' + flights_df['dest'].astype(str)
flights_df.head()

# Just checking the dates that are present in the dataset and getting a count
dates = pd.DataFrame(flights_df.date.unique())
dates.rename(columns={0:'date'}, inplace = True)
print "\nFor a flight to fly every day, it needs to fly these number of days: ", dates.date.count()

# Grouping by flight and date to see which flights fly on which days of the year
flights_rep = flights_df.groupby(['flight_combo','date']).count()
flights_rep.reset_index(level=0, inplace=True) # getting rid of the flight_combo index from the dataframe
flights_rep.reset_index(level=0, inplace=True) # getting rid of the date index from the dataframe
flights_rep.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0':'count'}, inplace = True)

# Counting number of days a given flight combo flies
flights_rep = flights_rep.groupby('flight_combo').count().sort_values('count', ascending = False) 
flights_rep.reset_index(level=0, inplace=True)

# Getting only flights that fly on all days (365 unique days of the current dataset)
flights_all_days = flights_rep[flights_rep['count'] == 365]['flight_combo']
print "\nThe flights (i.e. carrier + flight + dest) happen every day are: \n",flights_all_days

# Getting the destinations they fly to
destinations = []
for f in flights_all_days.astype(str):
    destinations.append(f[len(f)-3:])
destinations = set(destinations)
print "\nThe flights that fly every day fly to the following destinations: \n\n", destinations


# ## Answer

#       1. UA 15 HNL
#       2. B6 371 FLL
#       3. AA 181 LAX

# ## Answer
# Visibility, precipitation and temperature seem to be most interesting so we plot a bubble chart showing all these factors on a monthly scale. From the bubble chart, its clear that the months of December, June and July had the highest departure delays. The month of June had most precipitation (the area of bubble denotes the precipitation levels), July had the highest temperature and December had low temperatures and good precipitation.
